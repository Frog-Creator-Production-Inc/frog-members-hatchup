# AI Chat Assistant

The AI Chat Assistant is a key feature of Frog Members, providing personalized guidance and support to users throughout their educational journey.

## Overview

The AI Assistant uses natural language processing to:

- Answer questions about international education
- Provide personalized course recommendations
- Assist with visa application processes
- Offer guidance on application requirements
- Help users navigate the platform

## Technical Implementation

### Integration with OpenAI

The AI Assistant is powered by OpenAI's API:

- Uses GPT models for natural language understanding and generation
- Implements context management for conversational continuity
- Includes knowledge base integration for accurate responses
- Features prompt engineering for domain-specific expertise

### Implementation

The AI Assistant is implemented in the `app/aiagent/` directory:

- `page.tsx`: Main chat interface
- `components/`: UI components for the chat experience
- `actions.ts`: Server actions for processing messages
- `lib/ai-utils.ts`: Utility functions for AI processing

## User Experience

### Chat Interface

The chat interface provides:

- Message history with user and AI messages
- Text input for user questions
- Typing indicators during response generation
- Markdown rendering for formatted responses
- File and image sharing capabilities

### Conversation Context

The system maintains context throughout conversations:

- Remembers previous messages in the current session
- References user profile information for personalization
- Tracks conversation topics for coherent follow-ups
- Stores conversation history for future reference

## Admin Features

Administrators have additional capabilities:

- View chat logs for quality assurance
- Monitor common questions for content improvement
- Configure AI behavior and responses
- Set up automated responses for frequent queries
- Review analytics on assistant usage

## Integration Points

The AI Assistant integrates with several other system components:

- **User Profiles**: Accesses profile data for personalized responses
- **Course Database**: Retrieves course information for recommendations
- **Visa Information**: Provides guidance on visa requirements
- **Learning Resources**: References educational content in responses

## Example Implementation

```typescript
// Simplified example of the AI message processing
async function processAiMessage(
  userId: string,
  message: string,
  conversationId: string
) {
  // Get user context
  const userProfile = await getUserProfile(userId);
  
  // Get conversation history
  const conversationHistory = await getConversationHistory(conversationId);
  
  // Construct prompt with context
  const prompt = constructPrompt(message, userProfile, conversationHistory);
  
  // Call OpenAI API
  const response = await openai.createCompletion({
    model: "gpt-4",
    prompt,
    max_tokens: 1000,
    temperature: 0.7,
  });
  
  // Process and store response
  const aiResponse = response.choices[0].text;
  await storeMessage(conversationId, "assistant", aiResponse);
  
  return aiResponse;
}
```

## Security and Privacy

The AI Assistant implementation includes several security measures:

- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary user data is included in prompts
- **Content Filtering**: Prevents inappropriate content in responses
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects against excessive usage
- **Conversation Encryption**: Secures stored conversation data
- **User Consent**: Clear disclosure about data usage

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the AI Assistant include:

- Multi-language support for international users
- Voice interface for accessibility
- Integration with calendar for scheduling assistance
- Document analysis for application review
- Proactive notifications and reminders
